            <h2>Third Post</h2>
            <img src="pymarid.jpg" width="25%" height="20%" alt="">
            <p>pyramids:- a shape with a flat base and three of  four sides in the shape of triangles.....
                The Egyptian pyramids are ancient pyramid shaped masonry structures located in egypt  they have stood for nearly 5000 years, and it seems likely that they will continue to stand for thousands of years yet.and its makes the egypt more attractive...
                
                 They are over eighty of them scattered along the bank of the Nile, some of which are different in shape from the actual pyramids.  . 
                
                As of November 2008, sources cite either 118 or 138 as the number of identified Egyptian pyramids.Most were built as tombs for the country's pharaohs and their consorts during the old and middle kingdom periods.
                
                The earliest known Egyptian pyramids are found at saqqara, northwest of memphis, although at least one step-pyramid-like structure has been found at Saqqara, dating to the 1st Dynasty: Mastaba 3808, which has been attributed to the reign of Pharaoh Anedjib, with inscriptions, and other archaeological remains of the period, suggesting there may have been others. the otherwise earliest among these is the pyramid of Djoser built c. 2630â€“2610 BC during the third dynasty This pyramid and its surrounding complex are generally considered to be the world's oldest monumental structures constructed of dressed masonary
                
                The most famous Egyptian pyramids are those found at Giza on the outskirts of Cairo. Several of the Giza pyramids are counted among the largest structures ever built The Pyramid of Khufu at Giza is the largest Egyptian pyramid. It is the only one of the SEVEN WONDERS OF THE ANCIENT WORLD still in existence.......................
                
                  The pyramids are built thousands of years ago and still look beautiful. Most of the damage is done by humans because they are  greedy for treasure or, more often, for stone to use in modern buildings. The dry climate of Egypt has helped to protect the pyramids and their  shape has made them less likely to fall into ruins. These are good reasons why they can still be seen today, but perhaps the most important is that they were planned to last forever.....
                
                One thing is certain: there must have been months of careful planning before they could begin to build. The first thing they had to do was to choose a suitable place. You may think that this was an easy task, with miles and miles of empty desert around, but a pyramid could not be built just anywhere. Certain rules had to be followed strictly and certain problems overcome.
                
                The pyramid had to be on the west side of the Nile; the side on which the sun sets. This was for religious reasons. The pyramid also had to stand well above the level of the river to protect it against the regular floods. The pyramid could not be too far from the Nile, however, as the stones to build it needed to be carried in boats down the river to the nearest point. Water transport was, of course, much easier than land transport.. The builders also had to find rock, which was not likely to crack under the great wag of the pyramid. Finally, the pyramid had to be near the capital, or better still, near king's palace so that he could visit it easily and personally check the progress made on the final resting place for his body.  âœŒâœŒ
